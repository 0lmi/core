The cfengine 3 design and code is by Mark Burgess for Cfengine AS.

This version relies on libraries from cfengine 2.2.8 or later.
Later versions

In order to offer commericial support of cfengine to customers it is
important for Cfengine AS to have an uncomplicated ownership of rights
to cfengine 3 code in future products. For that reason we will require
that substantial code contrbutions (contributions of sufficient size
to warrant copyright) be accompanied by a signed transfer of rights
form to cfengine AS.

Such a transfer will not take away any of your freedoms under the GNU
public licence, but will guarantee that community contributions can be
included in cfengine's commerical future, without the need to split
cfengine into multiple versions i.e. this allows cfengine AS to make
money on commerical versions of cfengine thus supporting future
in-house development.
