This is the cfengine version 3 pre-release training pack
========================================================================

This is not a fully functional version of cfengine. It is a
package which will allow you to learn and experiment with
the modified language syntax in this version.

A functional, documented version of cfengine 3 is expected at the end
of 2008, but keep your eyes on the websites www.cfengine.org and
www.cfengine.com for more information.


BUILDING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build this software you need to have version 2.2.3 or greater of
cfengine 2 installed on your system, since cfengine 3 uses libraries
from the cfengine 2 to compile.

Type the following to build the software:

./configure;make

You do not need to install the software, nor do you need to run it
with root privileges as THIS SOFTWARE CURRENTLY MAKES NO CHANGES TO
YOUR SYSTEM.  It is recommend that you simply run it in the src
directory as a regular user.

With this software you can:

* practice making cfengine 3 configuration files
* test syntax and iteration of rules
* view expanded policy rules as html in your favourite web browser

EXAMPLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some basic documentation is provided in the docs directory. 

Input files containing example syntax are located in the tests
subdirectory.


TO USE this limited release:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

See the notes in the doc directory.

cd src

 ./cfpromise  (which looks for ../tests/promises.cf)

 ./cfpromises -f filename

e.g.

 ./cfpromises -f ../tests/mod_common.cf

This generates output to a file promise_output.html in
the current directory which is best examined with a web
browser.

You can examine a summary of the configuration e.g.

 firefox ../tests/mod_common.html

and you can see the evaluated promises, expanded for 
variables etc, e.g.

 firefox promise_output.html

For a summary of syntax:

 ./cfpromise -S > syntax.html
 firefox syntax.html

NOTES about this limited release:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The file promises.cf has some errors in it. See if you can
correct them.

Currently the supported types are:

Agent
================
vars:
classes:
files:
processes:
executables:     # Was shellcommands:
storage:         # Was disk/required/misc_mount
report:          # Was alert:

Server:
================
vars:
classes:
access:

Not yet supported in this release are "editfiles" which will now be a
part of "files", and routing promises. Both of these require more
research before they can be finalized.
