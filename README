This is a functional version of cfengine 3.

BUILDING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

cfengine 3 will eventually be indepedendent of cfengine 2, however to
build this version of the software you need to have the library
libcfengine from cfengine version 2.2.8 or later installed on your
system.

Type the following to build the software:

./configure;make

You do not need to install the software, nor do you need to run it
with root privileges as THIS SOFTWARE CURRENTLY MAKES NO CHANGES TO
YOUR SYSTEM.  It is recommend that you simply run it in the src
directory as a regular user.

TROUBLESHOOTING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Problems linking?

 Try getting the latest cfengine version directly from svn. You only
 need to install the library

 host$ cd /workdir
 host$ svn checkout https://svn.iu.hio.no/projects/cfengine-2/trunk
 host$ cd trunk; ./configure;make
 host$ cd src; install -c .libs/libcfengine.a /usr/local/lib/libcfengine.a

Some reports indicate that there is trouble compiling cfengine with
recent versions 4.x of gcc. No problems are reported with gcc 3.x.

EXAMPLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some basic documentation is provided in the docs directory. 

Input files containing example syntax are located in the tests
subdirectory.


TO USE this limited release:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

See the notes in the doc directory.

cd src

 ./cf-promises  (which looks for ../tests/promises.cf)

 ./cf-promises -f filename

e.g.

 ./cf-promises -f ../tests/mod_common.cf

This generates output to a file promise_output.html in
the current directory which is best examined with a web
browser.

You can examine a summary of the configuration e.g.

 firefox ../tests/mod_common.html

and you can see the evaluated promises, expanded for 
variables etc, e.g.

 firefox promise_output.html

For a summary of syntax:

 ./cfpromise -S > syntax.html
 firefox syntax.html

NOTES about this limited release:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The file promises.cf has some errors in it. See if you can
correct them.

Currently the supported types are:

Agent
================
vars:
classes:
files:
processes:
executables:     # Was shellcommands:
storage:         # Was disk/required/misc_mount
report:          # Was alert:

Server:
================
vars:
classes:
access:

Not yet supported in this release are "editfiles" which will now be a
part of "files", and routing promises. Both of these require more
research before they can be finalized.
