This is the cfengine version 3 pre-release training pack

To build this software you need to have version 2.2.3 of cfengine 2
installed on your system, since cfengine 3 will use the libraries
from the cfengine 2 to compile.

Type:

./configure;make

to build the program. You do not need to install this software yet as
it does nothing.  I recommend that you simply run it in the src
directory as a regular user.

THIS SOFTWARE CURRENTLY MAKES NO CHANGES TO YOUR SYSTEM. 

With this software you can:

* practice making cfengine 3 configuration files
* test syntax and iteration of rules
* view the impact as html in your favourite browser

The input files containing example syntax are located in the tests
subdirectory and some notes are contained in the docs directory.

A functional, documented version of cfengine 3 is expected at the end
of 2008, but keep your eyes on the websites www.cfengine.org and
www.cfengine.com for more information.

TO USE:

cd src

./cfpromise  (which looks for ../tests/promises.cf)

./cfpromises -f filename

e.g.

./cfpromises -f ../tests/mod_common.cf

This generates output to a file promise_output.html in
the current directory which is best examined with a web
browser.

NOTE

The file promises.cf has some errors in it. See if you can
correct them.
