Hosts or IP addresses that are explicitly denied access. This should
only be used in special circumstances.  One should never grant generic
access to everything and then deny special cases. Since the default
server behaviour is to grant no access to anything, this list is
unnecessary unless you have already granted access to some set of
hosts using a generic pattern, to which you intend to make an exception.
