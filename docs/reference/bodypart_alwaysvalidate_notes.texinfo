@i{History}: Was introduced in version 3.1.2,Nova 2.0.1 (2010)

The agents @code{cf-agent}, and @code{cfserverd} etc can run @code{cf-promises} to validate
inputs before attempting to execute a configuration. As of version 3.1.2 core, this only
happens if the configuration file has changed to save CPU cycles. When this attribute is set,
@code{cf-agent} will force a revalidation of the input.
