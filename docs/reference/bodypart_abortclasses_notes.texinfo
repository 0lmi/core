A list of class regular expressions that @code{cf-agent} will watch
out for. If any matching class becomes defined, it will cause the
current execution of @code{cf-agent} to be aborted. This may be used
for validation, for example. To handle class expressions, simply create
an alias for the expression with a single name.
