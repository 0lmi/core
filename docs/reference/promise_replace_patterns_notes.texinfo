This is a straightforward search and replace function.
Only the portion of the line that matches the pattern in the promise will be
replaced - the remainder of the line will not be affected.  You can also use
PCRE lookbehind and lookahead patterns to restrict the lines upon which the
pattern will match.

@b{NOTE:} In @code{replace_patterns} promises, the regular expression may
match a line fragment, that is, it is unanchored,
@xref{Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions}.
