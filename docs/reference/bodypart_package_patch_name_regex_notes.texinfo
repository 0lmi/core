A few package managers keep a separate notion of patches, as opposed to package updates.
OpenSuSE, for example, is one of these. This provide an analogous command struct to the
packages for patch updates. The regular expression may match a partial string (that is,
it is unanchored, @pxref{Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions}).
