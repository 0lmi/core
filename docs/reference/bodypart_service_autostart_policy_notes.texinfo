Defaults to @code{none}, which means that the service is not
registered for automatic startup by the operating system in any
way. It must be @code{none} if @code{service_policy} is not
@code{start}. @code{boot_time} means the service is started at boot
time, while @code{on_demand} means that the service is dispatched once
it is being used. 

@code{on_demand} is not supported by Windows, and is implemented
through inetd or xinetd on Unix.
