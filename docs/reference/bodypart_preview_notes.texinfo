Previewing shell scripts during a dry-run is a potentially misleading
activity. It should only be used on scripts that make no changes to
the system. It is cfengine best practice to never write
change-functionality into user-written scripts except as a last
resort: cfengine can apply its safety checks to user defined scripts.
