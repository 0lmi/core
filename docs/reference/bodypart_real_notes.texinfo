Real variables are strings that are expected to be used as real numbers. The
typing in cfengine is dynamic, so the variable types are interchangable, but
when you declare a variable to be type @code{real}, Cfengine verifies that
the value you assign to it looks like a real number (e.g., @samp{3}, 
@samp{3.1415}, @samp{.17}, @samp{6.02e23}, @samp{-9.21e-17}, etc).

Real numbers are not used in many places in cfengine, but they are
useful for representing probabilties and performance data.
