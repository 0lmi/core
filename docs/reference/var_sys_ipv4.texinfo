All four octets of the IPv4 address of the first system interface.

@noindent @b{Note}:@*

If your system has a single ethernet interface, @samp{$(sys.ipv4)} will
contain your IPv4 address.  However, if your system has multiple interfaces,
then @samp{$(sys.ipv4)} will simply be the IPv4 address of the first
interface in the list that has an assigned address, @xref{Variable sys.ipv4[interface_name]}, for details on obtaining the IPv4
addresses of all interfaces on a system.
