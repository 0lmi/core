Warning: this is a non-convergent operation. Although the end point
might stabilize in content, the operation will never quiesce. Use of
this feature is not recommended except in exceptional circumstances
since it creates a busy-dependency. If the copy is a network copy,
the system will be disturbed by network disruptions.
