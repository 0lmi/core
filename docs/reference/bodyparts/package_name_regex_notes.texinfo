This regular expression is only used when the @i{promiser} contains
not only the name of the package, but its version and archiecture
also. In that case, this expression should contain a single parenthesized
back-reference to extract the name of the package from the string.  The
regex may match a portion of the string (that is, it is unanchored,
@pxref{Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions})
