This indicate whether the package manager is capable of handling
package operations in bulk, i.e. with by given multiple arguments. If
this is set to @samp{bulk} then multiple arguments will be passed to
the package commands. If set to @samp{individual} packages will be
handled one by one. This might add a significant overhead to the
operations, and also affect the ability of the operating system's
package manager to handle dependencies.
