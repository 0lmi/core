This constraint is used only in adding data to database columns. Rows are considered to be
instances of individual columns. 

In the case of the system registry on Windows, the rows represent data on data-value pairs.
The currently supported types (the middle field) for the Windows registry are @code{REG_SZ} (string), 
@code{REG_EXPAND_SZ} (expandable string) and @code{REG_DWORD} (double word).
