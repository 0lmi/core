ACLs are supported on multiple platforms, which may have different
sets of available permission flags. By using the constraint
@code{acl_type}, we can specify which platform, or ACL API, we are
targeting with the ACL. The default, @code{generic}, is designed to
work on all supported platforms. However, if very specific permission
flags are required, like ``Take Ownership'' on the NTFS platform, we
must set @code{acl_type} to indicate the target platform. Currently,
the supported values are @code{posix} and @code{ntfs}.
