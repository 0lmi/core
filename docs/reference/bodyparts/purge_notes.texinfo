Purging files is a potentially dangerous matter during a file copy it
implies that any promiser (destination) file which is not matched by a
source will be deleted. Since there is no source, this means the file
will be irretrievable. Great care should be exercised when using this
feature.

Note that purging will also delete backup files generated during
the file copying if @code{copy_backup} is set to true.
