A policy for string replacement.

@noindent @b{Default value}:@*
The default value is "all".  Using "first" is generally unwise, as it is
possibly non-convergent (it will change a different matching string each time
the promise is executed, and may not "catch up" with whatever external action
is altering the text the promise applies to).
