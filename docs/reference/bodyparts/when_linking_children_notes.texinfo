The options refer to what happens if the directory exists already and
is already partially populated with files. If the directory being
copied from contains a file with the same name as that of a link
to be created, we must decide whether to override the existing
destination object with a link or simply omit the automatic
linkage for files that already exist. The latter case can
be used to make a copy of one directory with certain fields
overridden.
