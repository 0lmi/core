This list of regular expressions will ensure that files matching the
patterns of the list are never copied from more than one source during
a single run of @code{cf-agent}. This may be considered a protection
against accidential overlap of copies from diverse remote sources, or
as a first-come-first-served disambiguation tool for lazy-evaluation
of overlapping file-copy promises.
