A local, per-file sanity check to make sure the file editing is sensible.
If this is set to zero, the check is disabled and any size may be edited.
The default value of @code{max_file_size} is determined by the global
control body setting, @xref{editfilesize in agent}, whose default value is
@code{100k}.
