The list contains literal strings to search for in the secondary file (the file
being read via the @code{insert_type} attribute, not the main file being edited).
If the string is found in a line of the file, that line from the secondary
file will be inserted at the present location in the primary file.

@code{insert_if_contains_from_list} is ignored unless @code{insert_type} is @code{file}
(@pxref{insert_type in insert_lines}),
or the promiser is a multi-line block.
