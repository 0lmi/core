Delete lines from a file unless the lines @i{completely} match any of
the regular expressions listed (that is, the regular expressions
are anchored, @pxref{Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions}).

Note that the ``match'' determination is made only on promised lines (that is, this
attribute modifies the selection criteria, it does not make the initial
selection).
