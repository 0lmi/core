See also @code{select_start}. These delimiters mark out the region
of a file to be edited. In the example, it is assumed that the file
has section markes 

@smallexample
[section 1]

lines.
lines...


[section 2]

lines ....
etc..

@end smallexample

If you want to match from a starting location to the end of the file (even if
there are other lines matching @code{select_start} intervening), then just omit
the @code{select_end} promise and the selected region will run to the end of
the file.
