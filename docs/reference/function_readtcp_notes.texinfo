If the send string is empty, no data are sent or received from the socket. Then the
function only tests whether the TCP port is alive and returns an empty variable.

Note that on some systems the timeout mechanism does not seem to successfully interrupt
the waiting system calls so this might hang if you send a query string that is incorrect.
This should not happen, but the cause has yet to be diagnosed.
