If the version of a package is not specified separately using
@code{package_version}, then this should be a regular expression that
contains exactly one parenthesized back-reference that matches the version
string in the promiser.  The regular expression may match a partial string
(that is, it is unanchored, @pxref{Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions}).
