A local repository for this object, overrides the default, 
@xref{default_repository in agent, ,default_repository}.

Note that when a repository is specified, the files are stored using the
canonified directory name of the original file, concatenated with the name of
the file.  So, for example, @file{/usr/local/etc/postfix.conf} would ordinarily
be stored in an alternative repository as
@file{_usr_local_etc_postfix.conf.cfsaved}.
