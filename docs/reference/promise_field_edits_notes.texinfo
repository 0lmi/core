Field editing allows us to edit tabular files in a unique way, adding
and removing data from addressable fields. The @file{passwd} and
@file{group} files are classic examples of tabular files, but there
are many ways to use this feature, e.g. edit a string

@verbatim

VARIABLE="one two three"

@end verbatim

@noindent View this line as a tabular line separated by @samp{"} and
with sub-separator given by the space.
