The sub-topic or occurrence-type represented by the document reference
in a knowledge base. This string is intended as an annotation to the
reader about the nature of the inforation located in the occurrence
document. It should be used `creatively'.

If the document type is an image and one of the items in this list is
a url, beginning with either @samp{/} or @samp{http}, then
@code{cf-know} treats the reference as a url to be reached when the
image is clicked on.
