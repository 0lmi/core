This regular expression must match complete lines in the output
of the list command that are actually installed packages (that is,
the regex is anchored, @pxref{Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions}).
If all the lines match then the regex can be set of @samp{.*}, however
most package systems output prefix lines and a variety of human
padding that needs to be ignored.
