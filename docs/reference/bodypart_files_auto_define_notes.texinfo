Classes are automatically defined by the files that are copied.  The
file is named according to the prefixed `canonization' of the file
name.  Canonization means that non-identifier characters are converted
into underscores. Thus @file{/etc/passwd} would canonize to
@samp{_etc_passwd}. The prefix @samp{auto_} is added to clarify the
origin of the class. Thus in the example the copying of
@file{/etc/passwd} would lead to the class @samp{auto__etc_passwd}
being defined automatically.
