A possible form of attack on the fileserver is to request files based
on time by setting the clocks incorrectly. This option prevents
connections from clients whose clocks are drifting too far from the
server clock (where "too far" is currently defined as "more than an hour
off"). This serves as a warning about clock asynchronization
and also a protection against Denial of Service attempts based on
clock corruption.
