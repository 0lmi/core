A few package managers keep a separate notion of patches, as opposed to package updates.
OpenSuSE, for example, is one of these. This provide an analogous command struct to the
packages for patch updates.  The regular expression must match the entire line (that is,
it is anchored, @pxref{Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions}).
