A regular expression that contains exactly one parenthesized back
reference which marks the location in the listed package at which
the architecture is specified. The regular expression may match a

@pxref{Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions}). If no architecture
is specified for the given package manager, then do not define this
regex.
